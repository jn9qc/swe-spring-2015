Once upon a time


There was a dragon, and a Dover Demon walking around Dover, Massachusetts.
The dragon breathed his firey breath
The Dover Demon was terrorizing people with it's large head and tendril-like fingers. 
Together, the dragon and the Dover Demon destroyed Dover, Massachusetts.
Then, Agent Buckwald the Wizard appeared and froze the dragon and Dover Demon.
The wizard used all of his energy keeping them frozen, waiting until a worthy hero would rise up to slay them.
A noble hero stumbled upon the frozen foes and thought to himself, “If only I were 20 years younger, I could slay these here vermin and relive my days of glory!” Little did he know that Agent Buckwald the wizard had secretly been working on a potion to form a Link to the Past.
The noble hero drank the potion but it was too strong and the noble hero suddenly became a child.

The end.
